# Postnatural Collection - Where's Data?
The project **Where's Cloud?** is an attempt to demystify the hidden "Cloud" to the public - a collection of satellite images of data centers that are either owned by or contains the data of the three IT giants: Google, Facebook, and Amazon - as a web application created using Vue.js, SCSS, and Firebase.

The project displays approximately 100 different data centers from all around the world. The details of each data centers can be viewed by clicking on one of the pictures in the collection. Once you select on the image, depending on which company either owns or utilizes the selected data center, the background of the screen changes - yellow for Amazon, green for Google, and blue for Facebook. And, in the center, there will be a card with the image of the data center, the "official name" - which often has the name of the data center if it is not owned by the three IT companies, the address, and the latitude-longitude coordinates. When you click on the coordinates, it opens up Google Maps with the following coordinates where the data center is located.
